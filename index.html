<p>
A review paper is a scholarly article that summarizes and critically evaluates the current state of knowledge on a particular topic. 
It is a secondary source, meaning that it does not report original research, but rather synthesizes the findings of existing research.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress, resulting in highly capable software and advanced autonomous machines.
 Meanwhile, the cyber domain has become a battleground for access, influence, security and control. 
 This paper will address key AI technologies including machine learning 
 in an attempt to help in understanding their role in cyber security and the implications of these new technologies.
 This paper discusses and highlights different applications of machine learning in cyber security

          <p>
            Technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, 
            etc., have been repeated again and again in multiple forums, 
            in many cases without a clear understanding of their significance 
            or their application to solving real problems effectively. 
            AI is the creation of intelligent machines that can learn from experience,
             allowing them to work and react as a human would. 
             This technology enables computers to be trained to process large amounts 
             of data and identify trends and patterns.
